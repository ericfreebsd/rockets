For launch guidance of 1-6" diameter rockets, generally rail buttons are best.
Attaching them can become an issue.

On minimum diameter rockets, I skip the buttons entirely. A launch tower
or other more obscure methods can give better performance. But otherwise,
read on.

All fiberglass rockets need is a pair of holes in the right places. Using
a small bolt through the button and a hex nut on the inside of the rocket
means that the buttons can be easily maintained or replaced. However,
oftentimes the aft button belongs somewhere in the zone of the glued motor
mount. In this case I like to upsize the holes to fit a PEM nut. Work the
motor mount in at an angle, or install the PEM nut while the mount is
partially inserted. That way a nut can effectively stay in place despite
the area being inaccessible after the mount is installed.

Thin and strong materials like canvas phenolic or quantum tube can also
use this idea but trading the PEM nuts for well nuts. This also avoids the
maintenance issues since well nuts are operated entirely from the outside
of the structure.

Cardboard is more of a hassle. If there is enough working space, I like to
have a T nut or other structure provide threads for a small bolt. Otherwise,
consider gluing plastic rail guides. The old trick of drilling wood screws
in to the centering ring certainly works, but hitting the ring directly can
be difficult, and the threads will wear quickly.
